My birthday is in November. Sometimes, my friends and family ask what's on my wishlist. I used to have an Amazon.com wishlist, then an Amazon.co.uk wishlist, and now I choose not to use Amazon at all so I've put my wishlist up here instead. In no particular order, here are a few things that I would really like to receive as a gift:

* Scuba diving boots and fins. [These](https://www.simplyscuba.com/products/scubapro-delta-5-0-boot) look like they might be good? I probably wear a size 4.
* A rash vest, also for scuba diving, perhaps something like [this](https://shop.aquanautscuba.co.uk/shop/diving/en/product/snorkel/clothing-and-accessories/cressi/rash-guard-lady-long-sleeves-12603))
* A new prescription mask. For diving. (Notice a trend here?) The [Cressi Big Eyes Evo](https://www.watersportswarehouse.co.uk/collections/snorkeling-prescription-lenses/products/cressi-big-eyes-evo-mask-corrective-lenses) looks pretty good and they offer corrective lenses. You should email me to ask how bad my eyesight is before buying this for me though. ðŸ¤“
* I like [this nice bowl](https://otherwild.com/collections/zero-waste-kitchen/products/ceramic-silicone-lunch-bowl), and a lot of other pretty stuff on this site
* ~~Coffee from [Ritual roasters](https://www.ritualroasters.com) in California. I like bright, fruity coffees from Africa and when I brought some of this coffee back after my last visit to see my family I was very, very sad when it inevitably ran out.~~ I have enough coffee right now
* A gift voucher to the [shop where I buy gym clothes](https://www.sweatybetty.com/shop/gifts/gift-vouchers/sweaty-betty-gift-voucher-GIFTV_Grey.html)
* A wine chiller of any sort really, but [this Le Creuset one](https://www.lecreuset.co.uk/cooler-sleeve) looks like it's good for a small flat and effective at chilling.
* ~~I like the idea of [a book subscription](https://www.libreria-subscribe.com)~~ I have enough books to read right now
* Practice locks so I can work on my lockpicking skills
* A new head for my Benro backpacking tripod. The one I have currently is kinda
  fucked up and broken, but the tripod itself is really good still.
* Some nice over-ear headphones and/or desktop speakers for my desktop computer at home. I'm using a pair that are completely disintegrating, meaning the exposed foam is just oozing out. They still work okay. But a replacement wouldn't go amiss.

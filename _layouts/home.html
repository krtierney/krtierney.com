  <h1>Currently...</h1>
  <p>My role as Senior Developer at  <a href="https://www.happybearsoftware.com">Happy
        Bear Software</a> has been one of the best experiences of my career (which is
      really saying something, as I've had some incredible jobs in my life).
      Unfortunately, I now find myself in the dubious position of trying to
      decide where I'd like to go next. But first, I'll be going to Italy, because
      I have a holiday booked for the month of September and spending time with
      my US-based family is a rare treat.</p>
  <p>Lately, I've been reading <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em>
  and participating in a pair-study program on machine learning. I've also been
  giving some careful thought to what to do with this space. This blog/simple
  Jekyll site was never intended to be a portfolio pieceâ€”I just wanted a home
  for my thoughts while I was busy with work. If you want to know what I'm
  capable of, you're much better off just <a href="mailto:k@krtierney.com">asking me</a>.

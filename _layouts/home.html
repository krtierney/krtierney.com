    Wow, 2020. What a year, eh? I hope you're doing okay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lately, I've been keeping busy 
    <a href="http://librarything.com/catalog/kaitlynmeans" title="My book catalog on LibraryThing.com">
    reading books</a>, hanging out
    with the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CD8wV52DM95" title="Video of Toffee on Instagram">
    neighbours' cat</a>, and tending to dozens of houseplants.
    I've been writing words and code, Terraforming Mars and FaceTiming
    with my family in California and friends across the world, and
    taking a lot of naps. Sometimes I cook elaborate 10-course dinners.
    Some nights I lie in bed doomscrolling for too long and can only muster
    up the interest in eating a bowl of crisps.

    I'll be available for short-term software engineering/web development 
    contracts from November. I might be open to something longer term, 
    but I'd rather contract for you for a bit so you can get to know me instead 
    of going through a tedious and demoralising interviewing process. (Unless 
    you're Basecamp, hello, ðŸ‘‹ I will jump through any hoops you want.)

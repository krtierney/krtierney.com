    Hi, hello, howdy ðŸ‘‹
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm Kaitlyn. I'm generally a quiet, stay-at-home kind of software engineer. 
    But this year I'll be venturing outside of my home, and well outside of my comfort zone, 
    to speak at two conferences. Find me at StaffPlus on 28 June, and Brighton Ruby on 30 June.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please come say hello if you happen to see me there!
  </p>

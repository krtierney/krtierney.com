    Hi, hello, howdy ðŸ‘‹
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm Kaitlyn. You might have ended up here after seeing me speak in June at 
    StaffPlus in London or at Brighton Ruby. If you're just after the slides from 
    that talk, you can download a <a href="https://krt-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ktierney-librarian-tips-brighton-ruby.pdf">far-too-large full-res PDF</a>.
     If you need a different format, feel free to email me.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a holiday, family visit, and my child's first birthday party to prepare for, 
    I'm likely to be a bit slow on responding to emails through July and August. But I
    do love a well-considered email; rest assured I will reply eventually.

I read an average of a book a week. I use [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/) 
to [catalog my reading](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/krtierney). 

These are the 52 books I read in 2020.

<ul>
{% for data in site.data.books.2020 %}
{% assign book = data[1] %}

  <li>
    <em>{{book.title}}</em> by
    {{book.authors[0].fl}}
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

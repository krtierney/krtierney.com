I travel _a lot_. Exploring new places and breaking up my routine has been the
best way for me to cope with anxiety and depression, so any time I'm feeling
overwhelmed my first instinct is to hop on my bike, or a train, or an airplane.

I think my love of traveling has rubbed off a bit on the people I loveâ€”my family
all live thousands of miles away, so when we get together we'll often meet up
somewhere in between. Traveling together means that we don't suffer as much from
the imbalance of visiting someone in their regular life. If we're all on holiday
together, no one has to go to work or fit visiting and catching up around our 
jobs and routines.

My little sister turned 30 years old earlier this month. To celebrate her
birthday, she and her husband came to visit me in London, and then we all went
on for a long weekend in Barcelona. This was my second visit there, and I never
wanted to leave and can't wait to go back. The weather, the mountains, the
seaside, the great food and gin, the architecture...it reminds me of my
hometown, only better. If you're planning to visit Barcelona any time soon, here
are my recommendations.

* **Barcelona Street Art Tour**: We did the bike tour, and it was fantastic.
  It's hard to miss the marks made by the city's most prolific artists, but many
  of the best large murals are a bit off the beaten path. We took a tour with
  [Barcelona Street Style](http://barcelonastreetstyletour.com) guide Mike, who
  was well-versed in the city's artists and culture. Later we paid a visit to
  the [Base Elements](https://www.baseelements.net) gallery, where you can
  support the artists directly by purchasing their work.

* **Xixbar**: On the corner of C/ Rocafort and C/ Tamarit is an unassuming little
  gin joint with a blue awning. Select from a long list of infused gins for a
  gin&tonic, or pick your favourite from their massive wall of gins to drink
  neat. I went for a martini with Nordes gin, garnished with some of those fat,
  juicy Spanish olives, and it was perfect. The smoked cardamom g&t was also
  pretty great.

* **Lolita**:Across the street from Xixbar is Lolita, a brightly lit taperia
  with cheap house wine and good service. It's popular and crowded, and for good
  reason. We especially liked the aubergine with molasses and the braised leeks,
  which didn't pop up as frequently on other tapas menus around town.

* **Parlament**: We were staying in Sant Antoni, right across the street from a
  newish place called Parlament on (you guessed it) C/ Parlament. This spot has
  many tables but gets really busy on Fridays and Saturdays. Their sangria is
  really good and mixed to order, and the patatas bravas were the best we found.
  Go for the burrata or roasted vegetables with romesco sauce, but stay away
  from the olives if you're vegetarianâ€”they serve them stuffed with anchovies.

* **Rasoterra**: Speaking of vegetarian food, Rasoterra is an all-vegetarian
  tapas restaurant right across the street from Base Elements on C/ Palau. A lot
  of the food in this part of town is touristy, low-quality, and overpriced, but
  Rasoterra is phenomenal. They made us massive fishbowl gin&tonics with Gin
  Mares, and we ordered nearly everything on the menu, enjoying a long,
  leisurely lunch. The service was excellent; the trinxat with kimchi were even
  better.

* **Baracca**: We went to Baracca for paella, because even though we're all
  vegetarian, it seemed like we should try paella at least once in Spain. It was
  fine, and the presentation in a massive paella pan served at the table was
  nice. In the moments before we were served paella, when I was drinking a
  crisp, dry white wine out of a high-quality thin-walled wine glass, stuffing
  my face with the creamiest, most flavorful burrata and feeling the sea breeze
  on my face and sunshine on my shoulders...now that's something I'll be
  dreaming about for years. So sure, go for the paella, but don't miss that burrata
  and do try to get a table with a sea view. It's _very_ nice.

* **SÃ©samo**: We went to SÃ©samo for food after enduring one of [the worst "meals"
of my life](https://www.yelp.com/biz/beerlinale-barcelona). They have tons of 
vegan options, including a dessert that came with a flame-charred vegan
marshmallow, plus very nice service, and the food was good and reasonably priced.

* **TarannÃ **: We stopped by this little cafe on C/ Viladomat in Sant Antoni for
lunch before heading to the airport. They had an affordable prix fixe weekday
lunch special. The food was great, the ambience was even better. Looked like
they serve good coffee too, but I had wine with lunch instead.

* **GaudÃ­**: It would be a shame to visit Barcelona and not see any of the
  famous GaudÃ­ buildings. We did a guided tour of Sagrada Familia, but it isn't
  really worth it unless you're a big church fan (I'm really, really not, but
  went against my better judgment because so many people had recommended it). On
  my last visit to Barcelona, I toured Casa BattlÃ³ and stopped by La Pedrera and
  Parc GÃ¼ell, all of which were way more interesting and impressive than Sagrada.
  This time, we took a tour of the newly refurbished Palau GÃ¼ell, which was
  closed for renovations during my last visit. Palau GÃ¼ell was GaudÃ­'s first
  completed building, very ornate with a heavy hand on the finishings. The
  restoration has been done beautifully thoughâ€”it's stunning to see a building
  like that tucked away on the edge of El Raval.

* **The Vos Shop**: This little boutique has clothes from local designers at
  reasonable prices, and the customer service is great. Pretty limited range of
  sizes though. There are two locations; we visited the one in Sant Antoni.

* **Xocolat and xurros**: On my first visit to Barcelona way back in 2007, I
spent a lot of time searching for the best drinking chocolate and churros. After
many taste-tests, I decided Petritxol Xocoa, at C/ Petritxol 11, was the best.
This time around, the xurros were straight instead of curved, but other than
that it was exactly as I remembered. Order simply: thick, bittersweet custardy
drinking chocolate with fluffy, chewy churros, and skip the cream. Perfection.

* **Coffee**: NÃ¸mad and Satan's Coffee Corner were the two coffee places people
recommended to me. I had a cold brew at Satan's and it was great. Good coffee
doesn't seem to be too rare these days, but you could do a lot worse than this.

* **Orxata?**: People widely recommended Orxateria Sirvent to us. Maybe it's
  because I grew up with Mexican-style horchata, but I didn't find the Spanish
  orxata to my taste at all. Turns out it's [basically a completely different
  drink](http://randyclemens.com/2014/05/traditional-spanish-horchata-de-chufa-madrid-horchateria-alboraya/), made with tiger nuts instead of rice and cinnamon. Maybe just try it for
  yourself though; cups are small and only a couple euro.

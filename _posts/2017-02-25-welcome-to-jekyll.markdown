I started out following the quick-start guide on [Jekyll docs](jekyll-docs):

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll new
$ jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

As I read further through the docs and admired my new creation,
I quickly realised I was going to be making a lot of changes to
the default set-up, even for the simple site I had in mind. After
copying over the layout files from the `minima` gem to my site
folder, I set about pruning code, poking around, and
observing how everything is put together.

I'm still learning! Parts of it feel familiar. Jekyll uses
[Liquid syntax](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid), which feels familiar after
using Django at my last job. It's far more powerful than
I need for a site this simple, but it's fun to have a sandbox
to play around in.

However, I've only just realised that Liquid is part of
the Shopify family. I don't have much experience with
Shopify; all I know of them is that they provide the platform
for most of the revenue to America's fascist media outlet... so now
I feel much less great about how I spent my Saturday afternoon. ðŸ˜•

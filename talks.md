## StaffPlus 2023

I gave a talk, "Librarian's Guide to Documentation" at <a href="https://leaddev.com/staffplus-london-2023/video/librarians-guide-documentation?btr=7bbc21791bd80efc0c2a7fbd425c41be">LeadDev's StaffPlus conference in London</a>, which the LeadDev team have generously made available without the paywall to visitors clicking through from this page. Slides, including the full script, can be downloaded as a <a href="https://krt-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ktierney-librarian-tips-brighton-ruby.pdf">far-too-large full-res PDF</a> .
